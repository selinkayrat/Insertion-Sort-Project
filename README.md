[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1-Write the stages of the above given array according to the sort type.

2-Write the Big-O Notation

3-After sorting the array, which case does the number 18 belong to?


4-[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] write the first 4 stages of the array according to Insertion Sort.



1- [22,27,16,2,18,6]

    [22|,27,16,2,18,6]
   
    [22,27|,16,2,18,6]
   
    [16,22,27|,2,18,6]
   
    [2,16,22,27|,18,6]
   
    [2,16,18,22,27|,6]
   
    [2,6,16,18,22,27]
  
2- Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

   Best Case:  O(n)
   
3- Number 18 belongs to the average case.

4- [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

     [7|,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
     
    1 [3,7|,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
     
    2 [3,5,7|,8,2,9,4,15,6]
     
    3 [3,5,7,8|,2,9,4,15,6]
     
    4 [2,3,5,7,8|,9,4,15,6]
